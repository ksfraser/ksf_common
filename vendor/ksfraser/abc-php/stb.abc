W: Hark when the night is falling
W: Hear! Hear the pipes are calling,
W: Loudly and proudly calling
W: Down thro' the glen.
W: There where the hills are sleeping,
W: Now feel the blood a-leaping,
W: High as the spirits
W: Of the old Highland men.
W: 
W: Towering in gallant fame,
W: Scotland my mountain hame,
W: High may your proud standards
W: Gloriously wave!
W: Land of my high endeavour,
W: Land of the shining river,
W: Land of my heart for ever,
W: Scotland the brave.
W: 
W: High in the misty Highlands,
W: Out by the purple islands,
W: Brave are the hearts that beat
W: Beneath Scottish skies.
W: Wild are the winds to meet you,
W: Staunch are the friends that greet you,
W: Kind as the love that shines
W: From fair maidens' eyes.
W: 
W: Far off in sunlit places,
W: Sad are the Scottish faces,
W: Yearning to feel the kiss
W: Of sweet Scottish rain.
W: Where tropic skies are beaming,
W: Love sets the heart a-dreaming,
W: Longing and dreaming
W: For the homeland again.
